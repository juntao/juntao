### Michael J. Yuan

Trained as an astrophysicist, I have always been a scientist at heart. I started my career as an open source developer at [JBoss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBoss_(company)). After the successful exit of JBoss ([acq'ed by Red Hat](https://www.cnet.com/news/red-hat-scoops-up-jboss/)), I went back to academia and was awarded several million dollars in research funding from the NIH (National Institutes of Health) to study digital healthcare. I am now once again working on an open source startup to build the next generation infrastructure for cloud computing and blockchain. 

- 🦄 I’m currently working on [Second State](https://www.secondstate.io/) and [CMT](https://app.cybermiles.io/).
- 🦀 I’m currently learning [Rust](https://rust-by-example-ext.com/).
- 📝 I wrote a book on [Building Blockchain Apps](https://www.buildingblockchainapps.com/). It is published by Addison-Wesley in 2019.
