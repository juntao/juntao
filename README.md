### Michael J. Yuan

Trained as an astrophysicist, I have always been a scientist at heart. I started my career as an open source developer at [JBoss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBoss_(company)). After the successful exit of JBoss ([acq'ed by Red Hat](https://www.cnet.com/news/red-hat-scoops-up-jboss/)), I went back to academia and was awarded several million dollars in research funding from the NIH (National Institutes of Health) to study digital healthcare. I am now once again working on an open source startup to build the next generation infrastructure for AI agents on the edge and in the cloud.

- ðŸ¦„ I am the founder and maintainer of Linux Foundation / CNCF's [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) and [LlamaEdge](https://github.com/llamaedge) projects.
- ðŸŒ± I am also building on [Gaia](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node), a network of over 200k AI-based knowledge agents.
- ðŸ’° I am a Venture Partner at [SIG Ventures](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sig-china) investing in early stage tech and crypto teams.
- ðŸ“š I am the author of [6 books on software engineering](books.md), and many articles and papers.

- ðŸ§¬ I was the Principal Investigator (PI) for several NIH (National Institutes of Health) funded research projects.
- ðŸ”­ Fun fact: [My PhD dissertation](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/1462/yuand14885.pdf) was about super-massive blackholes in QSOs.
- ðŸ—ž I once published [an article on the New York Times](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2009/10/07/07venturebeat-will-health-20-startups-usher-in-consumer-dr-51571.html).
